                        After Codesmith, I increased my starting salary by 25% and
                        I landed my dream job; Here's how I did it.
                    <br />
                        <br />
                        Codesmith is a unique opportunity that, if you can get in, 
                        will give you leverage and skills that you can use to dramatically 
                        increase your starting salary and land your dream job.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Before Codesmith, I had a grasp of web technologies but lacked 
                        the computer science backbone and interviewing skills necessary 
                        to land a mid to senior level role at any company. This is where 
                        Codesmith really worked well for me. They helped me round out my 
                        skills and build really interesting technology that employers will 
                        *actually* be impressed by. They push you to do more than you think 
                        and by the end of it you look back and are in awe of how much you accomplished.
                        
                        Toward the end of the course, you really start to experience the 
                        invaluable tips and tricks that the Codesmith team provides you in 
                        preparation for job search. Resume reviews and practice phone screens 
                        prepare you for the real world and by the time I received my final offer 
                        a few months after the end of the course, I felt like a professional 
                        interviewer. I did it by following their process and trusting that it 
                        would work; and it did with flying colors.

                        We did this
                            <br />
                        <br />
                        <h3>For those considering Codesmith</h3>
                        I think it is dope.
