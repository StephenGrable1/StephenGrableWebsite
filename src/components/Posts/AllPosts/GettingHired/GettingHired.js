                        After Codesmith, I increased my starting salary by 25% and

                        <br />
                        Codesmith is a unique opportunity that, if you can get in,
                        will give you leverage and skills that you can use to dramatically
                        increase your starting salary and land your dream job.

                        <br />
                        Before Codesmith, I had a grasp of web technologies but lacked
                        the computer science backbone and interviewing skills necessary
                        to land a mid to senior level role at any company. This is where
                        Codesmith really worked well for me. They helped me round out my
                        skills and build really interesting technology that employers will
                        *actually* be impressed by. They push you to do more than you think
                        and by the end of it you look back and are in awe of how much you accomplished.

                        Toward the end of the course, you really start to experience the
                        invaluable tips and tricks that the Codesmith team provides you in
                        preparation for job search. Resume reviews and practice phone screens
                        prepare you for the real world and by the time I received my final offer
                        a few months after the end of the course, I felt like a professional
                        interviewer. I did it by following their process and trusting that it
                        would work; and it did with flying colors.

                        <h3>For those considering Codesmith</h3>
                        After Codesmith, I increased my starting salary by 25% and I landed my dream job; Here's how I did it.

First, I think Codesmith is a unique opportunity that, if you can get in, will give you the leverage and skills that you can use to dramatically increase your starting salary and land your dream job. With that being said, there is no hand holding there and to get the most out of the experience, you have to put in the time to work your coding skills and translate their lessons into real-world, working web applications. But hey, if it was easy, then it probably wouldn't be worth your while.

Before Codesmith, I had a grasp of some web technologies but lacked the computer science backbone and interviewing skills necessary to land a mid to senior level role. Codesmith helped me round out my skills and taught me all of the major modern technologies that companies ask for on their job listings. I learned through building challenging yet interesting projects and technologies that employers would *actually* be impressed by. To do this, the Codesmith staff pushes you to do more than you think and by the end of the course, you are in awe of how much you accomplished.

Toward the end of the course, you really start to experience the invaluable knowledge that the Codesmith team provides you in preparation for your job search. Resume reviews and practice phone screens prepare you for the real world and by the time you receive your final offer, you will feel like a professional interviewer. At least thats how I felt. I did it by following their process and trusting that it would work.

I was extremely excited when I received my offer because it was around the average for mid level engineers in NYC (currently $117,195 on Glassdoor) and it was with a company that I felt was a fantastic fit for me.

I certainly wouldn't have been able to accomplish this without Codesmith. I highly recommend it if you are looking to level up as a software engineer and dominate the job search to find the perfect job for you.
